# ðŸ§´ lotion

*A CLI tool for smooth note-taking, inspired by Notion, but with a little more... lotion.*

Manage your personal notes from the terminal and sync them with GitHub (or any git remote). Lotion keeps your notes silky and organized, so you can focus on what matters.

- **Sync** your notes with a remote git repository (like GitHub)
